    "Due to recent aviation regulations, many rules (your puzzle input) are being enforced about bags and their contents; bags must be color-coded and must contain specific quantities of other color-coded bags. Apparently, nobody responsible for these regulations considered how long they would take to enforce!\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.\n",
    "dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.\n",

    "dotted black bags contain no other bags.\n",

    "These rules specify the required contents for 9 bag types. In this example, every faded blue bag is empty, every vibrant plum bag contains 11 bags (5 faded blue and 6 dotted black), and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a shiny gold bag. If you wanted to carry it in at least one other bag, how many different bag colors would be valid for the outermost bag? (In other words: how many colors can, eventually, contain at least one shiny gold bag?)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above rules, the following options would be available to you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A bright white bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly.\n",
    "- A muted yellow bag, which can hold your shiny gold bag directly, plus some other bags.\n",
    "- A dark orange bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.\n",
    "- A light red bag, which can hold bright white and muted yellow bags, either of which could then hold your shiny gold bag.\n",

    "It's getting pretty expensive to fly these days - not because of ticket prices, but because of the ridiculous number of bags you need to buy!\n",

    "- vibrant plum bags contain 11 other bags: 5 faded blue bags and 6 dotted black bags.\n",

    "\n",
    "Of course, the actual rules have a small chance of going several levels deeper than this example; be sure to count all of the bags, even if the nesting becomes topologically impractical!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "shiny gold bags contain 2 dark red bags.\n",
